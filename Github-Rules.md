## **Rule 1:** Use GitHub to Track Your Projects
+ Tony Rossini: “commit early, commit often, and commit in a repository from which we can easily roll-back your mistakes,”

## **Rule 2:** GitHub for Single Users, Teams, and Organizations
+ Public projects on GitHub are visible to everyone, but write permission needs to be granted explicitly
+ As a repository owner, you can grant this right to other GitHub users
+ Repositories can also be created and managed as part of teams and organizations

## **Rule 3:** Developing and Collaborating on New Features: Branching and Forking
+ Forking a repository allows users to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project and forms the basis of social coding
+ Forking a repository and providing pull requests constitutes a simple method for collaboration inside loosely defined teams
+ Many contributors can work on the same repository at the same time without running into edit conflicts -> Git branches
+ BUT there is a risk of applying incompatible changes in different branches/forks; these are said to become *out of sync*


## **Rule 4:** Naming Branches and Commits: Tags and Semantic Versions
## **Rule 5:** Let GitHub Do Some Tasks for You: Integrate
## **Rule 6:** Let GitHub Do More Tasks for You: Automate
## **Rule 7:** Use GitHub to Openly and Collaboratively Discuss, Address, and Close Issues
## **Rule 8:** Make Your Code Easily Citable, and Cite Source Code!
## **Rule 9:** Promote and Discuss Your Projects: Web Page and More
## **Rule 10:** Use GitHub to Be Social: Follow and Watch
